In this essay we will speak about Blockchain, a distributed database used in 
cryptocurrencies to store transactions.

Blockchain solves the double-spending problem and is involved in the 
cryptocurrencies procedure called `mining'. An important feature that this 
database is able to offer is privacy. We will see how this aspect allow people 
to perform pseudo-anonymous payments.

Finally, we will analyze different ways to attack a Blockchain database and how 
to mitigate these threats.
